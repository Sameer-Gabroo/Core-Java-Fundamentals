Java Exceptions

An exception is an unexpected event that occurs during program execution. It affects the flow of the program instructions which can cause the program to terminate abnormally.

An exception can occur for many reasons. Some of them are:

Invalid user input
Device failure
Loss of network connection
Physical limitations (out of disk memory)
Code errors
Opening an unavailable file



 There are 2 types of Exception Runtime exception and compile time exception.

 Run Time Exception : Is basically a programmer fault means if i write i code to acces the index 10 of array lenght 5 then it will through the indexOutOfBound error.
 Compile Time Exception / IO Exception (Input output Exception )  : Is basically when the code is getting compiled and if the files is missing which code is trying to access is called
 as Compile time Exception. so basically we got this erorr while we are  dealing with secandrey memory.
